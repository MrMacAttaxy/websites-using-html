This project is made by for Google Sites and Vercel. Should work with other hosting platforms.
<h1>What do we have?</h1>
<p>
  Moonlight 3.0
  <br />
  Equinox From Scratch

<h1>How this was made</h1>
My school has this code you can put at the end of a link to unblock it and it just so happens that the code works for moonlight link: https://howtoscratch.info and it works in an iframe. So I made an iframe with https://howtscratch.info/ (The code), Idk if this is just a my school thing but hopefully this is not. I copied the source code for moonlight and replaced the non-valid links with https://howtoscratch.info/(The original non-valid link) and it worked. This could also work if your school doesn't block stuff inside of iframes.

Always good to test this out to see if it works for you. I reccommend using vercel or google sites for moonlight. For equinox I reccomend downloading it because iit is much easier than using google sites or just use vercel.
