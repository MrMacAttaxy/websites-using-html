This project is made by for Google Sites and Vercel. Should work with other hosting platforms.

  Equinox From Scratch

<h1>How this was made</h1>
I used VsCode on my school chromebook to make Equinox from Scratch.

Always good to test this out to see if it works for you. I reccommend using vercel or google sites for moonlight. For equinox I reccomend downloading it because iit is much easier than using google sites or just use vercel.
